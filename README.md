## 📖 The Problem

> "I was tired of spending hours taking screenshots of my Jupyter notebooks for lab reports. There had to be a better way."

As a student/researcher, I spent countless hours manually capturing screenshots from Jupyter notebooks to include in lab reports and documentation. This tedious, time-consuming process interrupted my workflow and reduced productivity.

**AutoLabDocs** was born from laziness and frustration – the two greatest motivators for innovation.

## ✨ Solution

AutoLabDocs automates the conversion of Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) to beautifully formatted DOCX and PDF documents with a single click. No more screenshots, no more manual formatting, no more wasted time.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **⏱️ Save Hours of Work** - No more manual screenshots or tedious formatting
- **💻 Beautiful Code Formatting** - Automatic syntax highlighting and proper indentation
- **📄 Multiple Export Formats** - Export to DOCX, PDF, or both simultaneously
